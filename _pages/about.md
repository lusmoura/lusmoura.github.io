Hey, my name is LuÃ­sa Moura, I'm 24 and I was born and raised in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I'm currently a Software Engineer at Cohere. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and I previously worked as a Solutions Engineer and Software Engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook).


Other than that, I love adventure and all sorts of random things. I practice Kung Fu and play basketball and in my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and novels, watching series of dubious quality, watching superhero movies, and listening to indie music.
