Hey, my name is LuÃ­sa Moura, I'm 22 and I was born and raised in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of SÃ£o Paulo and working as a Solutions Engineering Intern at Facebook.

Other than that, I love adventure and all sorts of random things. I practice Kung Fu and play basketball and in my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and novels, watching series of dubious quality, watching superhero movies, and listening to indie music.
